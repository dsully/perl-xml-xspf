An XSPF parser should be able to handle all files in the "pass"
directory and should detect the error in all files in the "fail"
directory.

This is initially intended for use by feedvalidator
(http://feedvalidator.org), which is where the syntax for "Expect:"
clauses comes from.  That said, these test cases should be useful for
anybody writing a parser.
